                  I am convinced the only way to make money online is to
                  have a consistent Advertising plan. A plan you are willing
                  to work hard on and commit to for a selected period of
                  time. When making this plan, you need to do two things.
                  First, you should pick a few affiliate programs that are
                  of interest to you. Second, you need to decide how long
                  you want to work these programs. Once you decide on

                <p>
                  Next, you need to consider your advertising options:
                  traffic exchanges, classified ads, e-mail campaigns, ezine
                  articles, posting to forums or message boards, chatting
                  with others who are interested in what you have to offer,
                  and posting flyers around your town. Now you see the many
                  possible advertising avenues you can choose from. I
                  recommend doing all of them. It may sound like a lot of
                  work,
